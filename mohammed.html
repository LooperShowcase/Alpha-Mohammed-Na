    <h1>shawarma</h1>
    


    
    <p>Shawarma (/ʃəˈwɑːrmə/; Arabic: شاورما) is a popular Middle Eastern dish that originated in the Ottoman Empire[1][2][3][4] consisting of meat cut into thin slices, stacked in an inverted cone, and roasted on a slowly turning vertical rotisserie or spit. Traditionally made with lamb or mutton, it may also be made with chicken, turkey, beef, or veal.[5][6][1] Thin slices are shaved off the cooked surface as it continuously rotates.[7][8] Shawarma is a popular street food in the greater Middle East, including Lebanon, Egypt, Kuwait, Iraq, and the Levant, also served widely in Saudi Arabia.</p><hr>
<h1>Etymology</h1>
<p>Shawarma is an Arabic rendering of Turkish term çevirme ([tʃeviɾˈme], "turning"), referring to the turning rotisserie.[10]

<h1>History</h1>
<p>Although the roasting of meat on horizontal spits has an ancient history, the shawarma technique—grilling a vertical stack of meat slices and cutting it off as it cooks—first appeared in the 19th-century Ottoman Empire, in what is now Turkey, in the form of doner kebab.[1][11][12] Both the Greek gyros and shawarma are derived from this.[1][2][13] Shawarma, in turn, led to the development during the early 20th century of the contemporary Mexican dish tacos al pastor when it was brought there by Lebanese immigrants.[2][14]

<h1>Preparations</h1>
<p>Shawarma is prepared from thin cuts of seasoned and marinated lamb, mutton, veal, beef, chicken, or turkey. The slices are stacked on a skewer about 60 cm (20 in) high. Pieces of fat may be added to the stack to provide extra juiciness and flavor. A motorized spit slowly turns the stack of meat in front of an electric or gas-fired heating element, continuously roasting the outer layer. Shavings are cut off the rotating stack for serving, customarily with a long, flat knife.[1]

Spices may include cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, turmeric, and/or paprika, and in some areas baharat.[14][3] Shawarma is commonly served as a sandwich or wrap, in a flatbread such as pita or laffa.[1][15] In the Middle East, chicken shawarma is typically served with garlic sauce, fries, and pickles. The garlic sauce served with the sandwich depends on the meat. Toum or toumie sauce is made from garlic, vegetable oil, lemon, and egg white or starch, and is usually served with chicken shawarma. Tarator sauce is made from garlic, tahini sauce, lemon, and water, and is served with beef shawarma.

In Israel, most shawarma is made with dark-meat turkey and is commonly served with tahina sauce because yogurt sauce with meat would violate the Jewish dietary prohibition on eating milk and meat together.[14] It is often garnished with diced tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, pickled vegetables, hummus, tahina sauce, sumac, or amba mango sauce.[1] Some restaurants offer additional toppings, including grilled peppers, eggplant, or french fries.[16]

In Bahrain, there is a popular variant of the shawarma, referred to as a malgoum, which is a traditional shawarma, but with the addition of french fries and cheese.</p><hr>
