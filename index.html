    <p>Samsung Group,[3] or simply Samsung (Korean: 삼성; RR: samseong [samsʌŋ]) (stylized as SΛMSUNG), is a South Korean multinational manufacturing conglomerate headquartered in Samsung Town, Seoul, South Korea.[1] It comprises numerous affiliated businesses,[1] most of them united under the Samsung brand, and is the largest South Korean chaebol (business conglomerate). As of 2020, Samsung has the eighth highest global brand value.[4]

Samsung was founded by Lee Byung-chul in 1938 as a trading company. Over the next three decades, the group diversified into areas including food processing, textiles, insurance, securities, and retail. Samsung entered the electronics industry in the late 1960s and the construction and shipbuilding industries in the mid-1970s; these areas would drive its subsequent growth. Following Lee's death in 1987, Samsung was separated into five business groups – Samsung Group, Shinsegae Group, CJ Group and Hansol Group, and JoongAng Group.

Notable Samsung industrial affiliates include Samsung Electronics (the world's largest information technology company, consumer electronics maker and chipmaker measured by 2017 revenues),[5][6] Samsung Heavy Industries (the world's second largest shipbuilder measured by 2010 revenues),[7] and Samsung Engineering and Samsung C&T Corporation (respectively the world's 13th and 36th largest construction companies).[8] Other notable subsidiaries include Samsung Life Insurance (the world's 14th largest life insurance company),[9] Samsung Everland (operator of Everland Resort, the oldest theme park in South Korea)[10] and Cheil Worldwide (the world's 15th largest advertising agency, as measured by 2012 revenues).[11][12</p><hr>
<h1>Etymology</h1>
<p>According to Samsung's founder, the meaning of the Korean hanja word Samsung (三星) is "three stars". The word "three" represents something "big, numerous and powerful",[13] while "stars" means "everlasting" or "eternal", like stars in the sky.[14][15]

<h1>Influence in South Korea
</h1>

<p>Samsung has a powerful influence on South Korea's economic development, politics, media and culture and has been a major driving force behind the "Miracle on the Han River".[53][54] Its affiliate companies produce around a fifth of South Korea's total exports.[55] Samsung's revenue was equal to 17% of South Korea's $1,082 billion GDP in 2013.[56]

"You can even say the Samsung chairman is more powerful than the President of South Korea. [South] Korean people have come to think of Samsung as invincible and above the law", said Woo Suk-hoon, host of a popular economics podcast in a Washington Post article headlined "In South Korea, the Republic of Samsung", published on 9 December 2012. Critics claimed that Samsung knocked out smaller businesses, limiting choices for South Korean consumers and sometimes colluded with fellow giants to fix prices while bullying those who investigate. Lee Jung-hee, a South Korean presidential candidate, said in a debate, "Samsung has the government in its hands. Samsung manages the legal world, the press, the academics and bureaucracy".[57]</p>
